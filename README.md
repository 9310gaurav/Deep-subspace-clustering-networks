Tensorflow implementation of our NIPS'17 paper:

Pan Ji*, Tong Zhang*, Hongdong Li, Mathieu Salzmann, Ian Reid. Deep Subspace Clustering Networks. in NIPS'17.

Due to several requests, an unpolished version of our codes (for EYaleB) is released here. A better commented/polished version will come soon.
